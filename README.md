This repository contains code and models for an analysis of plausible family relationships between two Iron Age individuals from Southwestern Germany (the central burials of Hochdorf and Asperg). 

The repository contains stan-models and their analysis in Mathematica notebooks, as well as Mathematica scripts to prepare the figures used in a forthcoming paper referencing this repository.
